    "aerodynamics": "Aerodynamics (Ancient Greek: \u1f00\u03ae\u03c1 aero (air) + Ancient Greek: \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (dynamics)) is the study of the motion of air, particularly when affected by a solid object, such as an airplane wing. It involves topics covered in the field of fluid dynamics and its subfield of gas dynamics, and is an important domain of study in aeronautics. The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that \"gas dynamics\" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag were recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving heavier-than-air flight, which was first demonstrated by Otto Lilienthal in 1891. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, and computer simulations has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies. Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to compressible flow, turbulence, and boundary layers and has become increasingly computational in nature.\n\n",
    "slipstream": "A slipstream is a region behind a moving object in which a wake of fluid (typically air or water) is moving at velocities comparable to that of the moving object, relative to the ambient fluid through which the object is moving. The term slipstream also applies to the similar region adjacent to an object with a fluid moving around it. \"Slipstreaming\" or \"drafting\" works because of the relative motion of the fluid in the slipstream.\n\n",
    "unsteadiness": "Vertigo is a condition in which a person has the sensation that they are moving, or that objects around them are moving, when they are not. Often it feels like a spinning or swaying movement. It may be associated with nausea, vomiting, perspiration, or difficulties walking. It is typically worse when the head is moved. Vertigo is the most common type of dizziness.\nThe most common disorders that result in vertigo are benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease, and vestibular neuritis. Less common causes include stroke, brain tumors, brain injury, multiple sclerosis, migraines, trauma, and uneven pressures between the middle ears. Physiologic vertigo may occur following being exposed to motion for a prolonged period such as when on a ship or simply following spinning with the eyes closed. Other causes may include toxin exposures such as to carbon monoxide, alcohol, or aspirin. Vertigo typically indicates a problem in a part of the vestibular system. Other causes of dizziness include presyncope, disequilibrium, and non-specific dizziness.\nBenign paroxysmal positional vertigo is more likely in someone who gets repeated episodes of vertigo with movement and is otherwise normal between these episodes. Benign vertigo episodes generally last less than one minute. The Dix-Hallpike test typically produces a period of rapid eye movements known as nystagmus in this condition. In M\u00e9ni\u00e8re's disease there is often ringing in the ears, hearing loss, and the attacks of vertigo last more than twenty minutes. In vestibular neuritis the onset of vertigo is sudden, and the nystagmus occurs even when the person has not been moving. In this condition vertigo can last for days. More severe causes should also be considered, especially if other problems such as weakness, headache, double vision, or numbness occur.\nDizziness affects approximately 20\u201340% of people at some point in time, while about 7.5\u201310% have vertigo. About 5% have vertigo in a given year. It becomes more common with age and affects women two to three times more often than men. Vertigo accounts for about 2\u20133% of emergency department visits in the developed world.\n\n",
    "viscoelasticity": "In materials science and continuum mechanics, viscoelasticity is the property of materials that exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation. Viscous materials, like water, resist both shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied. Elastic materials strain when stretched and immediately return to their original state once the stress is removed.\nViscoelastic materials have elements of both of these properties and, as such, exhibit time-dependent strain. Whereas elasticity is usually the result of bond stretching along crystallographic planes in an ordered solid, viscosity is the result of the diffusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material.\n\n",
    "shock": "Shock is the state of insufficient blood flow to the tissues of the body as a result of problems with the circulatory system. Initial symptoms of shock may include weakness, tachycardia, hyperventilation, sweating, anxiety, and increased thirst. This may be followed by confusion, unconsciousness, or cardiac arrest, as complications worsen.\nShock is divided into four main types based on the underlying cause: hypovolemic, cardiogenic, obstructive, and distributive shock. Hypovolemic shock, also known as low volume shock, may be from bleeding, diarrhea, or vomiting. Cardiogenic shock may be due to a heart attack or cardiac contusion. Obstructive shock may be due to cardiac tamponade or a tension pneumothorax. Distributive shock may be due to sepsis, anaphylaxis, injury to the upper spinal cord, or certain overdoses.\nThe diagnosis is generally based on a combination of symptoms, physical examination, and laboratory tests. A decreased pulse pressure (systolic blood pressure minus diastolic blood pressure) or a fast heart rate raises concerns.\nShock is a medical emergency and requires urgent medical care. If shock is suspected, emergency help should be called immediately. While waiting for medical care, the individual should be, if safe, laid down (except in cases of suspected head or back injuries). The legs should be raised if possible, and the person should be kept warm. If the person is unresponsive, breathing should be monitored and CPR may need to be performed.\n\n",
    "gust": "Guster is an American alternative rock band formed in Somerville, Massachusetts. Founding members Adam Gardner, Ryan Miller, and Brian Rosenworcel began practice sessions while attending Tufts University and formed the band in 1991. The members met during the freshman Wilderness Orientation program in August of that year, playing publicly together as a trio two months later at the Midnight Cafe coffee house set in the common area of the Lewis Hall dormitory. While attending Tufts, the band lived at 139 College Avenue in Somerville.\nThe band stayed \"underground\" for its first two full-length albums, Parachute (1994) and Goldfly (1997), but broke into the musical mainstream in 1999 with its third studio album Lost and Gone Forever, featuring the single \"Fa Fa\", which made it onto the Adult Top 40. The band enjoyed moderate success on the charts with Keep It Together, its fourth album, with two singles in the Adult Top 40 (\"Careful\" and \"Amsterdam\"). Joe Pisapia joined the official lineup for Keep It Together and its follow-up, Ganging Up on the Sun, which peaked at 25 on the Billboard 200. A variety of television shows and movies have featured the band's music, including Martian Child, which featured their song \"Satellite\"; Disturbia; Wedding Crashers; Life as a House, which makes several allusions to the band throughout the film; The O.C.; and one of the band's songs was used in an ad for The Weather Channel. The band earned its first gold record in 2018 for its single \"Satellite\".\nGuster's tours were originally local, but began to spread as the band gained popularity. In 1999, Guster gave its first performance in Canada, followed by a 2004 tour in Britain that had four shows in London and one in Manchester. Guster maintains a liberal taping policy and has a very dedicated and active taping community. In addition, the band has released several live shows via iTunes.",
    "drag": "A drag queen is a person, usually male,  who uses drag clothing and makeup to imitate and often exaggerate female gender signifiers and gender roles for entertainment purposes. Historically, drag queens have usually been gay men, and have been a part of gay culture.\nPeople do drag for reasons ranging from self-expression to mainstream performance. Drag shows frequently include lip-syncing, live singing, and dancing. They typically occur at LGBTQ pride parades, drag pageants, cabarets, carnivals, and nightclubs. Drag queens vary by type, culture, and dedication, from professionals who star in films and spend a lot of their time in their drag personas, to people who do drag only occasionally. Women who dress as men and entertain by imitating them are called drag kings.\nThose who do occasional drag may be from other backgrounds than the LGBT community. There is a long history of folkloric and theatrical crossdressing that involves people of all orientations. Not everyone who does drag at some point in their lives is a drag queen or a drag king.",
    "lifting": "A lifting gas or lighter-than-air gas is a gas that has a density lower than normal atmospheric gases and rises above them as a result, making it useful in lifting lighter-than-air aircraft. Only certain lighter-than-air gases are suitable as lifting gases. Dry air has a density of about 1.29 g/L (gram per liter) at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP) and an average molecular mass of 28.97 g/mol, and so lighter-than-air gases have a density lower than this.",

    "viscid": "An earthworm is a soil-dwelling terrestrial invertebrate that belongs to the phylum Annelida. The term is the common name for the largest members of the class (or subclass, depending on the author) Oligochaeta. In classical systems, they were in the order of Opisthopora since the male pores opened posterior to the female pores, although the internal male segments are anterior to the female. Theoretical cladistic studies have placed them in the suborder Lumbricina of the order Haplotaxida, but this may change. Other slang names for earthworms include \"dew-worm\", \"rainworm\", \"nightcrawler\", and \"angleworm\" (from its use as angling hookbaits). Larger terrestrial earthworms are also called megadriles (which translates to \"big worms\") as opposed to the microdriles (\"small worms\") in the semiaquatic families Tubificidae, Lumbricidae and Enchytraeidae. The megadriles are characterized by a distinct clitellum (more extensive than that of microdriles) and a vascular system with true capillaries.\nEarthworms are commonly found in moist, compost-rich soil, eating a wide variety of organic matters, which include detritus, living protozoa, rotifers, nematodes, bacteria, fungi and other microorganisms. An earthworm's digestive system runs the length of its body. They are one of nature's most important detritivores and coprophages, and also serve as food for many low-level consumers within the ecosystems.\nEarthworms exhibit an externally segmented tube-within-a-tube body plan with corresponding internal segmentations, and usually have setae on all segments. They have a cosmopolitan distribution wherever soil, water and temperature conditions allow. They have a double transport system made of coelomic fluid that moves within the fluid-filled coelom and a simple, closed circulatory system, and respire (breathe) via cutaneous respiration. As soft-bodied invertebrates, they lack a true skeleton, but their structure is maintained by fluid-filled coelom chambers that function as a hydrostatic skeleton.\nEarthworms have a central nervous system consisting of two ganglia above the mouth, one on either side, connected to an axial nerve running along its length to motor neurons and sensory cells in each segment. Large numbers of chemoreceptors concentrate near its mouth. Circumferential and longitudinal muscles edging each segment let the worm move. Similar sets of muscles line the gut tube, and their actions propel digested food toward the worm's anus.\nEarthworms are hermaphrodites: each worm carries male and female reproductive organs and  genital pores. When mating, two individual earthworms will exchange sperm and fertilize each other's ova.\n\n",
    "flowmeter": "Flow measurement is the quantification of bulk fluid movement.  Flow can be measured using devices called flowmeters in various ways. The common types of flowmeters with industrial applications are listed below:\n\nObstruction type (differential pressure or variable area)\nInferential (turbine type)\nElectromagnetic\nPositive-displacement flowmeters, which accumulate a fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times the volume is filled to measure flow.\nFluid dynamic (vortex shedding)\nAnemometer\nUltrasonic flow meter\nMass flow meter (Coriolis force).\nFlow measurement methods other than positive-displacement flowmeters rely on forces produced by the flowing stream as it overcomes a known constriction, to indirectly calculate flow. Flow may be measured by measuring the velocity of fluid over a known area. For very large flows, tracer methods may be used to deduce the flow rate from the change in concentration of a dye or radioisotope.",
    "deceleration": "In mechanics, acceleration is the rate of change of the velocity of an object with respect to time. Acceleration is one of several components of kinematics, the study of motion. Accelerations are vector quantities (in that they have magnitude and direction). The orientation of an object's acceleration is given by the orientation of the net force acting on that object. The magnitude of an object's acceleration, as described by Newton's second law, is the combined effect of two causes:\n\nthe net balance of all external forces acting onto that object \u2014 magnitude is directly proportional to this net resulting force;\nthat object's mass, depending on the materials out of which it is made \u2014 magnitude is inversely proportional to the object's mass.\nThe SI unit for acceleration is metre per second squared (m\u22c5s\u22122, \n  \n    \n      \n        \n          \n            \n              m\n              \n                s\n                \n                  2\n                \n              \n            \n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle \\mathrm {\\tfrac {m}{s^{2}}} }\n  \n).\nFor example, when a vehicle starts from a standstill (zero velocity, in an inertial frame of reference) and travels in a straight line at increasing speeds, it is accelerating in the direction of travel. If the vehicle turns, an acceleration occurs toward the new direction and changes its motion vector.  The acceleration of the vehicle in its current direction of motion is called a linear (or tangential during circular motions) acceleration, the reaction to which the passengers on board experience as a force pushing them back into their seats. When changing direction, the effecting acceleration is called radial (or centripetal during circular motions) acceleration, the reaction to which the passengers experience as a centrifugal force. If the speed of the vehicle decreases, this is an acceleration in the opposite direction of the velocity vector (mathematically a negative, if the movement is unidimensional and the velocity is positive), sometimes called deceleration or retardation, and passengers experience the reaction to deceleration as an inertial force pushing them forward.  Such negative accelerations are often achieved by retrorocket burning in spacecraft. Both acceleration and deceleration are treated the same, as they are both changes in velocity. Each of these accelerations (tangential, radial, deceleration) is felt by passengers until their relative (differential) velocity are neutralised in reference to the acceleration due to change in speed.\n\n",
    "deflection": "A deflection yoke is a kind of magnetic lens, used in cathode ray tubes to scan the electron beam both vertically and horizontally over the whole screen.\nIn a CRT television, the electron beam is moved in a raster scan on the screen. By adjusting the strength of the beam current, the brightness of the light produced by the phosphor on the screen can be varied.  The cathode ray tube allowed the development of all-electronic television.\nElectromagnetic deflection yokes are also used in certain radar displays.",
    "transient": "ECHELON, originally a secret government code name, is a surveillance program (signals intelligence/SIGINT collection and analysis network) operated by the five signatory states to the UKUSA Security Agreement: Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States, also known as the Five Eyes.\nCreated in the late 1960s to monitor the military and diplomatic communications of the Soviet Union and its Eastern Bloc allies during the Cold War, the ECHELON project became formally established in 1971. By the end of the 20th century, it had greatly expanded.",
    "streamlining": "A streamliner is a vehicle incorporating streamlining in a shape providing reduced air resistance. The term is applied to high-speed railway trainsets of the 1930s to 1950s, and to their successor \"bullet trains\". Less commonly, the term is applied to fully faired upright and recumbent bicycles. As part of the Streamline Moderne trend, the term was applied to passenger cars, trucks, and other types of light-, medium-, or heavy-duty vehicles, but now vehicle streamlining is so prevalent that it is not an outstanding characteristic. In land speed racing, it is a term applied to the long, slender, custom built, high-speed vehicles with enclosed wheels.",
    "ballistic": "A ballistic missile is a type of missile that uses projectile motion to deliver warheads on a target. These weapons are powered only during relatively brief periods\u2014most of the flight is unpowered. Short-range ballistic missiles (SRBM) typically stay within the Earth's atmosphere, while most larger missiles travel outside the atmosphere. The type of ballistic missile with the greatest range is an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). The largest ICBMs are capable of full orbital flight.\nThese missiles are in a distinct category from cruise missiles, which are aerodynamically guided in powered flight and thus restricted to the atmosphere.",
    "freestream": "The freestream is the air far upstream of an aerodynamic body, that is, before the body has a chance to deflect, slow down or compress the air.

    "tailplane": "A tailplane, also known as a horizontal stabilizer, is a small lifting surface located on the tail (empennage) behind the main lifting surfaces of a fixed-wing aircraft as well as other non-fixed-wing aircraft such as helicopters and gyroplanes. Not all fixed-wing aircraft have tailplanes. Canards, tailless and flying wing aircraft have no separate tailplane, while in V-tail aircraft the vertical stabilizer, rudder, and the tail-plane and elevator are combined to form two diagonal surfaces in a V layout.\nThe function of the tailplane is to provide stability and control. In particular, the tailplane helps adjust for changes in position of the centre of pressure or centre of gravity caused by changes in speed and attitude, fuel consumption, or dropping cargo or payload.\n\n",
    "hydroballistic": "The Mk44 Bushmaster II is a 30 mm chain gun manufactured by Northrop Grumman.

The barrel is chromium-plated for extended life. The gun uses standard GAU-8 Avenger ammunition that is available in API (Armor-Piercing Incendiary), HEI (High-Explosive Incendiary) and APFSDS-T (Armor-Piercing Fin-Stabilized Discarding Sabot-Tracer) variants.\nThe gun can be converted to a caliber of 40\u00d7180 mm, which involves changing the barrel and a few key parts, to use the SuperShot 40 cartridge. It can also be converted to use the 30\u00d7170 mm RARDEN cartridge.",
    "mechanism": "The Antikythera mechanism ( AN-tik-ih-THEER-\u0259, US also  AN-ty-kih-) is an Ancient Greek hand-powered orrery (model of the Solar System). It is the oldest known example of an analogue computer. It could be used to predict astronomical positions and eclipses decades in advance. It could also be used to track the four-year cycle of athletic games similar to an Olympiad, the cycle of the ancient Olympic Games.\nThe artefact was among wreckage retrieved from a shipwreck off the coast of the Greek island Antikythera in 1901. In 1902, it was identified by archaeologist Valerios Stais as containing a gear. The device, housed in the remains of a wooden-framed case of (uncertain) overall size 34 cm \u00d7 18 cm \u00d7 9 cm (13.4 in \u00d7 7.1 in \u00d7 3.5 in), was found as one lump, later separated into three main fragments which are now divided into 82 separate fragments after conservation efforts. Four of these fragments contain gears, while inscriptions are found on many others. The largest gear is about 13 cm (5 in) in diameter and originally had 223 teeth. All these fragments of the mechanism are kept at the National Archaeological Museum, Athens, along with reconstructions and replicas, to demonstrate how it may have looked and worked.\nIn 2005, a team from Cardiff University led by Mike Edmunds used computer X-ray tomography and high resolution scanning to image inside fragments of the crust-encased mechanism and read the faintest inscriptions that once covered the outer casing. These scans suggest that the mechanism had 37 meshing bronze gears enabling it to follow the movements of the Moon and the Sun through the zodiac, to predict eclipses and to model the irregular orbit of the Moon, where the Moon's velocity is higher in its perigee than in its apogee. This motion was studied in the 2nd century BC by astronomer Hipparchus of Rhodes, and he may have been consulted in the machine's construction. There is speculation that a portion of the mechanism is missing and it calculated the positions of the five classical planets. The inscriptions were further deciphered in 2016, revealing numbers connected with the synodic cycles of Venus and Saturn.\nThe instrument is believed to have been designed and constructed by Hellenistic scientists and been variously dated to about 87 BC, between 150 and 100 BC, or 205 BC. It must have been constructed before the shipwreck, which has been dated by multiple lines of evidence to approximately 70\u201360 BC. In 2022, researchers proposed its initial calibration date, not construction date, could have been 23 December 178 BC. Other experts propose 204 BC as a more likely calibration date. Machines with similar complexity did not appear again until the 14th century in western Europe.\n\n",
    "slope": "In mathematics, the slope or gradient of a line is a number that describes the direction of the line on a plane. Often denoted by the letter m, slope is calculated as the ratio of the vertical change to the horizontal change (\"rise over run\") between two distinct points on the line, giving the same number for any choice of points. \nThe line may be physical \u2013 as set by a road surveyor, pictorial as in a diagram of a road or roof, or abstract.\nAn application of the mathematical concept is found in the grade or gradient in geography and civil engineering. \nThe steepness, incline, or grade of a line is the absolute value of its slope: greater absolute value indicates a steeper line. The line trend is defined as follows: \n\nAn \"increasing\" or \"ascending\" line goes up from left to right and has positive slope: \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        >\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m>0}\n  \n.\nA \"decreasing\" or \"descending\" line goes down from left to right and has negative slope: \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        <\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m<0}\n  \n.\nSpecial directions are:\n\nA \"(square) diagonal\" line has unit slope: \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        1\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m=1}\n  \n\nA \"horizontal\" line (the graph of a constant function) has zero slope: \n  \n    \n      \n        m\n        =\n        0\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle m=0}\n  \n.\nA \"vertical\" line has undefined or infinite slope (see below).\nIf two points of a road have altitudes y1 and y2, the rise is the difference (y2 \u2212 y1) = \u0394y. Neglecting the Earth's curvature, if the two points have horizontal distance x1 and x2 from a fixed point, the run is (x2 \u2212 x1) = \u0394x.

When the curve is approximated by a series of points, the slope of the curve may be approximated by the slope of the secant line between two nearby points. When the curve is given as the graph of an algebraic expression, calculus gives formulas for the slope at each point. Slope is thus one of the central ideas of calculus and its applications to design.\n\n",
    "diaphragm": "The thoracic diaphragm, or simply the diaphragm (; Ancient Greek: \u03b4\u03b9\u03ac\u03c6\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bc\u03b1, romanized: di\u00e1phragma, lit.\u2009'partition'), is a sheet of internal skeletal muscle in humans and other mammals that extends across the bottom of the thoracic cavity. The diaphragm is the most important muscle of respiration, and separates the thoracic cavity, containing the heart and lungs, from the abdominal cavity: as the diaphragm contracts, the volume of the thoracic cavity increases, creating a negative pressure there, which draws air into the lungs. Its high oxygen consumption is noted by the many mitochondria and capillaries present; more than in any other skeletal muscle.\nThe term diaphragm in anatomy, created by Gerard of Cremona, can refer to other flat structures such as the urogenital diaphragm or pelvic diaphragm, but \"the diaphragm\" generally refers to the thoracic diaphragm. In humans, the diaphragm is slightly asymmetric\u2014its right half is higher up (superior) to the left half, since the large liver rests beneath the right half of the diaphragm. There is also speculation that the diaphragm is lower on the other side due to heart's presence.\nOther mammals have diaphragms, and other vertebrates such as amphibians and reptiles have diaphragm-like structures, but important details of the anatomy may vary, such as the position of the lungs in the thoracic cavity.",
    "navier": "The Navier\u2013Stokes equations ( nav-YAY STOHKS) are partial differential equations which describe the motion of viscous fluid substances.  They were named after French engineer and physicist Claude-Louis Navier and the Irish physicist and mathematician George Gabriel Stokes.  They were developed over several decades of progressively building the theories, from 1822 (Navier) to 1842\u20131850 (Stokes).\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations mathematically express momentum balance for Newtonian fluids and make use of conservation of mass. They are sometimes accompanied by an equation of state relating pressure, temperature  and density. They arise from applying Isaac Newton's second law to fluid motion, together with the assumption that the stress in the fluid is the sum of a diffusing viscous term (proportional to the gradient of velocity) and a pressure term\u2014hence describing viscous flow. The difference between them and the closely related Euler equations is that Navier\u2013Stokes equations take viscosity into account while the Euler equations model only inviscid flow. As a result, the Navier\u2013Stokes are an elliptic equation and therefore have better analytic properties, at the expense of having less mathematical structure (e.g. they are never completely integrable).\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations are useful because they describe the physics of many phenomena of scientific and engineering interest. They may be used to model the weather, ocean currents, water flow in a pipe and air flow around a wing. The Navier\u2013Stokes equations, in their full and simplified forms, help with the design of aircraft and cars, the study of blood flow, the design of power stations, the analysis of pollution, and many other problems. Coupled with Maxwell's equations, they can be used to model and study magnetohydrodynamics.\nThe Navier\u2013Stokes equations are also of great interest in a purely mathematical sense. Despite their wide range of practical uses, it has not yet been proven whether smooth solutions always exist in three dimensions\u2014i.e., whether they are infinitely differentiable (or even just bounded) at all points in the domain. This is called the Navier\u2013Stokes existence and smoothness problem. The Clay Mathematics Institute has called this one of the seven most important open problems in mathematics and has offered a US$1 million prize for a solution or a counterexample.\n\n",
    "subsonically": "Subsonic ammunition is ammunition designed to operate at velocities below the speed of sound (Mach 1), which at standard conditions is 340.29 m/s (1,116.4 ft/s). This avoids the supersonic shockwave or \"crack\" of a supersonic bullet, which, particularly for suppressed firearms, influences the loudness of the shot.\nSubsonic ammunition usually uses heavier bullets to retain as much kinetic energy as possible at the lower velocities.  Some subsonic ammunition is used in non-suppressed firearms to gain the advantages of heavier bullet weights.",

    "electrohydrodynamic": "Electrohydrodynamics (EHD), also known as electro-fluid-dynamics (EFD) or electrokinetics, is the study of the dynamics of electrically charged fluids. Electrohydrodynamics (EHD) is a joint domain of electrodynamics and fluid dynamics mainly focused on the fluid motion induced by electric fields. EHD, in its simplest form, involves the application of an electric field to a fluid medium, resulting in fluid flow, form, or properties manipulation. These mechanisms arise from the interaction between the electric fields and charged particles or polarization effects within the fluid. The generation and movement of charge carriers (ions) in a fluid subjected to an electric field are the underlying physics of all EHD-based technologies.\n\nThe electric forces acting on particles consist of electrostatic (Coulomb) and electrophoresis force (first term in the following equation)., dielectrophoretic force (second term in the following equation), and electrostrictive force (third term in the following equation):\n\n  \n    \n      \n        \n          F\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        =\n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            e\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            E\n            \u2192\n          \n        \n        \u2212\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03b5\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              E\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \u25bd\n        \n          \u03b5\n          \n            r\n          \n        \n        +\n        \n          \n            1\n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03b5\n          \n            0\n          \n        \n        \u25bd\n        \n          \n            (\n          \n        \n        \n          \n            \n              E\n              \u2192\n            \n          \n          \n            2\n          \n        \n        \n          \u03c1\n          \n            f\n          \n        \n        \n          (\n          \n            \n              \n                \u2202\n                \n                  \u03b5\n                  \n                    r\n                  \n                \n              \n              \n                \u2202\n                \n                  \u03c1\n                  \n                    f\n                  \n                \n              \n            \n          \n          )\n        \n        \n          \n            )\n          \n        \n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle F_{e}=\\rho _{e}{\\overrightarrow {E}}-{1 \\over 2}\\varepsilon _{0}{\\overrightarrow {E}}^{2}\\triangledown \\varepsilon _{r}+{1 \\over 2}\\varepsilon _{0}\\triangledown {\\Bigl (}{\\overrightarrow {E}}^{2}\\rho _{f}\\left({\\frac {\\partial \\varepsilon _{r}}{\\partial \\rho _{f}}}\\right){\\Bigr )}}\n  \n\nThis electrical force is then inserted in Navier-Stokes equation, as a body (volumetric) force.EHD covers the following types of particle and fluid transport mechanisms: electrophoresis, electrokinesis, dielectrophoresis, electro-osmosis, and electrorotation. In general, the phenomena relate to the direct conversion of electrical energy into kinetic energy, and vice versa.\nIn the first instance, shaped electrostatic fields (ESF's) create hydrostatic pressure (HSP, or motion) in dielectric media. When such media are fluids, a flow is produced. If the dielectric is a vacuum or a solid, no flow is produced. Such flow can be directed against the electrodes, generally to move the electrodes. In such case, the moving structure acts as an electric motor. Practical fields of interest of EHD are the common air ioniser, electrohydrodynamic thrusters and EHD cooling systems.\nIn the second instance, the converse takes place. A powered flow of medium within a shaped electrostatic field adds energy to the system which is picked up as a potential difference by electrodes. In such case, the structure acts as an electrical generator.\n\n",
    "intuition": "Intuition is the ability to acquire knowledge, without recourse to conscious reasoning or needing an explanation. Different fields use the word \"intuition\" in very different ways, including but not limited to: direct access to unconscious knowledge; unconscious cognition; gut feelings; inner sensing; inner insight to unconscious pattern-recognition; and the ability to understand something instinctively, without any need for conscious reasoning. Intuitive knowledge tends to be approximate.\nThe word intuition comes from the Latin verb intueri translated as \"consider\" or from the late middle English word intuit, \"to contemplate\". Use of intuition is sometimes referred to as responding to a \"gut feeling\" or \"trusting your gut\".\n\n",
    "drosophila": "Drosophila (), from Ancient Greek \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (dr\u00f3sos), meaning \"dew\", and \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (ph\u00edlos), meaning \"loving\", is a genus of fly, belonging to the family Drosophilidae, whose members are often called \"small fruit flies\" or pomace flies, vinegar flies, or wine flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be confused with the Tephritidae, a related family, which are also called fruit flies (sometimes referred to as \"true fruit flies\"); tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit, with many species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly.\nOne species of Drosophila in particular, Drosophila melanogaster, has been heavily used in research in genetics and is a common model organism in developmental biology. The terms \"fruit fly\" and \"Drosophila\" are often used synonymously with D. melanogaster in modern biological literature. The entire genus, however, contains more than 1,500 species and is very diverse in appearance, behavior, and breeding habitat.",
    "sweptback": "A swept wing is a wing angled either backward or occasionally forward from its root rather than perpendicular to the fuselage.\nSwept wings have been flown since the pioneer days of aviation. Wing sweep at high speeds was first investigated in Germany as early as 1935 by Albert Betz and Adolph Busemann, finding application just before the end of the Second World War. It has the effect of delaying the shock waves and accompanying aerodynamic drag rise caused by fluid compressibility near the speed of sound, improving performance. Swept wings are therefore almost always used on jet aircraft designed to fly at these speeds.\nThe term \"swept wing\" is normally used to mean \"swept back\", but variants include forward sweep, variable sweep wings and oblique wings in which one side sweeps forward and the other back. The delta wing is also aerodynamically a form of swept wing.\n\n",
    "bypass": "A turbofan or fanjet is a type of airbreathing jet engine that is widely used in aircraft propulsion. The word \"turbofan\" is a combination of references to the preceding generation engine technology of the turbojet and the additional fan stage. It consists of a gas turbine engine which achieves mechanical energy from combustion, and a ducted fan that uses the mechanical energy from the gas turbine to force air rearwards. Thus, whereas all the air taken in by a turbojet passes through the combustion chamber and turbines, in a turbofan some of that air bypasses these components. A turbofan thus can be thought of as a turbojet being used to drive a ducted fan, with both of these contributing to the thrust.\nThe ratio of the mass-flow of air bypassing the engine core to the mass-flow of air passing through the core is referred to as the bypass ratio. The engine produces thrust through a combination of these two portions working together. Engines that use more jet thrust relative to fan thrust are known as low-bypass turbofans; conversely those that have considerably more fan thrust than jet thrust are known as high-bypass. Most commercial aviation jet engines in use are of the high-bypass type, and most modern fighter engines are low-bypass. Afterburners are used on low-bypass turbofan engines with bypass and core mixing before the afterburner.\nModern turbofans have either a large single-stage fan or a smaller fan with several stages. An early configuration combined a low-pressure turbine and fan in a single rear-mounted unit.",

    "reanalysis": "Folk etymology \u2013 also known as (generative) popular etymology, analogical reformation, (morphological) reanalysis and etymological reinterpretation \u2013 is a change in a word or phrase resulting from the replacement of an unfamiliar form by a more familiar one through popular usage. The form or the meaning of an archaic, foreign, or otherwise unfamiliar word is reinterpreted as resembling more familiar words or morphemes.\nThe term folk etymology is a loan translation from German Volksetymologie, coined by  Ernst F\u00f6rstemann in 1852. Folk etymology is a productive process in historical linguistics, language change, and social interaction. Reanalysis of a word's history or original form can affect its spelling, pronunciation, or meaning. This is frequently seen in relation to loanwords or words that have become archaic or obsolete.\nFolk/popular etymology may also refer to a popular false belief about the etymology of a word or phrase that does not lead to a change in the form or meaning. To disambiguate the usage of the term \"folk/popular etymology\", Ghil'ad Zuckermann proposes a clear-cut distinction between the derivational-only popular etymology (DOPE) and the generative popular etymology (GPE): the DOPE refers to a popular false etymology involving no neologization, and the GPE refers to neologization generated by a popular false etymology.\nExamples of words created or changed through folk etymology include the English dialectal form sparrowgrass, originally from Greek \u1f00\u03c3\u03c0\u03ac\u03c1\u03b1\u03b3\u03bf\u03c2 (\"asparagus\") remade by analogy to the more familiar words sparrow and grass. When the alteration of an unfamiliar word is limited to a single person, it is known as an eggcorn.",
    "derivation": "In mathematics, a derivation is a function on an algebra that generalizes certain features of the derivative operator.  Specifically, given an algebra A over a ring or a field K, a K-derivation is a K-linear map D : A \u2192 A that satisfies Leibniz's law:\n\n  \n    \n      \n        D\n        (\n        a\n        b\n        )\n        =\n        a\n        D\n        (\n        b\n        )\n        +\n        D\n        (\n        a\n        )\n        b\n        .\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle D(ab)=aD(b)+D(a)b.}\n  \n\nMore generally, if M is an A-bimodule, a K-linear map D : A \u2192 M that satisfies the Leibniz law is also called a derivation.  The collection of all K-derivations of A to itself is denoted by DerK(A).  The collection of K-derivations of A into an A-module M is denoted by DerK(A, M).\nDerivations occur in many different contexts in diverse areas of mathematics.  The partial derivative with respect to a variable is an R-derivation on the algebra of real-valued differentiable functions on Rn.  The Lie derivative with respect to a vector field is an R-derivation on the algebra of differentiable functions on a differentiable manifold; more generally it is a derivation on the tensor algebra of a manifold. It follows that the adjoint representation of a Lie algebra is a derivation on that algebra. The Pincherle derivative is an example of a derivation in abstract algebra. If the algebra A is noncommutative, then the commutator with respect to an element of the algebra A defines a linear endomorphism of A to itself, which is a derivation over K. That is,\n\n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        F\n        G\n        ,\n        N\n        ]\n        =\n        [\n        F\n        ,\n        N\n        ]\n        G\n        +\n        F\n        [\n        G\n        ,\n        N\n        ]\n        ,\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [FG,N]=[F,N]G+F[G,N],}\n  \n\nwhere \n  \n    \n      \n        [\n        \u22c5\n        ,\n        N\n        ]\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle [\\cdot ,N]}\n  \n is the commutator with respect to \n  \n    \n      \n        N\n      \n    \n    {\\displaystyle N}\n  \n. An algebra A equipped with a distinguished derivation d forms a differential algebra, and is itself a significant object of study in areas such as differential Galois theory.",
    "ascertained": "In the United States, a certificate of ascertainment is an official document that identifies a state's appointed electors for U.S. President and Vice President, and the final vote count for each candidate that received popular votes.\n\n",
    "redirecting": "URL redirection, also called URL forwarding, is a World Wide Web technique for making a web page available under more than one URL address. When a web browser attempts to open a URL that has been redirected, a page with a different URL is opened. Similarly, domain redirection or domain forwarding is when all pages in a URL domain are redirected to a different domain, as when wikipedia.com and wikipedia.net are automatically redirected to wikipedia.org.\nURL redirection is done for various reasons:\n\nfor URL shortening;\nto prevent broken links when web pages are moved;\nto allow multiple domain names belonging to the same owner to refer to a single web site;\nto guide navigation into and out of a website;\nfor privacy protection (such as redirecting YouTube and Twitter links to Invidious and Nitter respectively or to turn AMP links into normal links); and\nfor hostile purposes such as phishing attacks or malware distribution.",
    "define": "A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories: intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term), and extensional definitions (which try to list the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\nIn mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what the mathematical term is and is not. Definitions and axioms form the basis on which all of modern mathematics is to be constructed.\n\n",
    "induce": "In molecular biology, an inducer is a molecule that regulates gene expression. An inducer functions in two ways; namely:\n\nBy disabling repressors. The gene is expressed because an inducer binds to the repressor. The binding of the inducer to the repressor prevents the repressor from binding to the operator. RNA polymerase can then begin to transcribe operon genes.\nBy binding to activators. Activators generally bind poorly to activator DNA sequences unless an inducer is present. Activator binds to an inducer and the complex binds to the activation sequence and activates target gene. Removing the inducer stops transcription.\nBecause a small inducer molecule is required, the increased expression of the target gene is called induction. The lactose operon is one example of an inducible system.",
    "dissertation": "A thesis (pl.: theses), or dissertation (abbreviated diss.), is a document submitted in support of candidature for an academic degree or professional qualification presenting the author's research and findings. In some contexts, the word thesis or a cognate is used for part of a bachelor's or master's course, while dissertation is normally applied to a doctorate. This is the typical arrangement in American English. In other contexts, such as within most institutions of the United Kingdom, South Africa, the Commonwealth Countries, and Brazil, the reverse is true. The term graduate thesis is sometimes used to refer to both master's theses and doctoral dissertations.\nThe required complexity or quality of research of a thesis or dissertation can vary by country, university, or program, and the required minimum study period may thus vary significantly in duration.\nThe word dissertation can at times be used to describe a treatise without relation to obtaining an academic degree. The term thesis is also used to refer to the general claim of an essay or similar work.\n\n",
    "appendix": "The appendix (pl.: appendices or appendixes; also vermiform appendix;  cecal (or caecal, c\u00e6cal) appendix; vermix; or vermiform process) is a finger-like, blind-ended tube connected to the cecum, from which it develops in the embryo. \nThe cecum is a pouch-like structure of the large intestine, located at the junction of the small and the large intestines. The term \"vermiform\" comes from Latin and means \"worm-shaped\". The appendix was once considered a vestigial organ, but this view has changed since the early 2000s. Research suggests that the appendix may serve as a reservoir for beneficial gut bacteria.",
    "1947": "1947 (MCMXLVII) was a common year starting on Wednesday of the Gregorian calendar, the 1947th year of the Common Era (CE) and Anno Domini (AD) designations, the 947th  year of the 2nd millennium, the 47th  year of the 20th century, and the  8th   year of the 1940s decade.  \nIt was the first year of the Cold War, which would last until 1991, ending with the dissolution of the Soviet Union.",
    "discontinuity": "Continuous functions are of utmost importance in mathematics, functions and applications. However, not all functions are continuous. If a function is not continuous at a limit point (also called \"accumulation point\" or \"cluster point\") of its domain, one says that it has a discontinuity there. The set of all points of discontinuity of a function may be a discrete set, a dense set, or even the entire domain of the function.\nThe oscillation of a function at a point quantifies these discontinuities as follows:\n\nin a removable discontinuity, the distance that the value of the function is off by is the oscillation;\nin a jump discontinuity, the size of the jump is the oscillation (assuming that the value at the point lies between these limits of the two sides);\nin an essential discontinuity (a.k.a. infinite discontinuity), oscillation measures the failure of a limit to exist.\nA special case is if the function diverges to infinity or minus infinity, in which case the oscillation is not defined (in the extended real numbers, this is a removable discontinuity).\n\n",
    "0001": "The 0s began on January 1, AD 1 and ended on December 31, AD 9, covering the first nine years of the Common Era.\nIn Europe, the 0s saw the continuation of conflict between the Roman Empire and Germanic tribes in the Early Imperial campaigns in Germania. Vinicius, Tiberius and Varus led Roman forces in multiple punitive campaigns, before sustaining a major defeat at the hands of Arminius in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest. Concurrently, the Roman Empire fought the Bellum Batonianum against a rebelling alliance of native peoples led by Bato the Daesitiate in Illyricum, which was suppressed in AD 9. A conflict also took place in Korea, where Daeso, King of Dongbuyeo invaded Goguryeo with a 50,000-man army in AD 6. He was forced to retreat when heavy snow began to fall, stopping the conflict until the next decade. In China, the last ruler of the Chinese Western Han dynasty (Ruzi Ying) was deposed, allowing Wang Mang to establish the Xin dynasty.\nLiterary works from the 0s include works from the ancient Roman poet Ovid; the Ars Amatoria, an instructional elegy series in three books, Metamorphoses, a poem which chronicles the history of the world from its creation to the deification of Julius Caesar within a loose mythico-historical framework, and Ibis, a curse poem written during his years in exile across the Black Sea for an offense against Augustus. Nicolaus of Damascus wrote the 15-volume History of the World.\nEstimates for the world population by AD 1 range from 170 to 300 million. A census was concluded in China in AD 2: final numbers showed a population of nearly 60 million (59,594,978 people in slightly more than 12 million households). The census is one of the most accurate surveys in Chinese history.",
    "11in": "Guillermo Kahlo (born Carl Wilhelm Kahlo; 26 October 1871 \u2013 14 April 1941) was a German-Mexican photographer. He photographically documented important architectural works, churches, streets, landmarks, as well as industries and companies in Mexico at the beginning of the 20th century; because of this, his work has not only artistic value but also historical and documental importance. He was the father of painter Frida Kahlo.",
    "agrees": "To \"agree to disagree\" is to resolve a conflict (usually a debate or quarrel) by having all parties tolerating but not accepting the opposing positions. It generally occurs when all sides recognize that further conflict would be unnecessary, ineffective or otherwise undesirable."
