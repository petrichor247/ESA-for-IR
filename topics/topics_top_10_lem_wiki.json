    "aerodynamics": "Aerodynamics (Ancient Greek: \u1f00\u03ae\u03c1 aero (air) + Ancient Greek: \u03b4\u03c5\u03bd\u03b1\u03bc\u03b9\u03ba\u03ae (dynamics)) is the study of the motion of air, particularly when affected by a solid object, such as an airplane wing. It involves topics covered in the field of fluid dynamics and its subfield of gas dynamics, and is an important domain of study in aeronautics. The term aerodynamics is often used synonymously with gas dynamics, the difference being that \"gas dynamics\" applies to the study of the motion of all gases, and is not limited to air. The formal study of aerodynamics began in the modern sense in the eighteenth century, although observations of fundamental concepts such as aerodynamic drag were recorded much earlier. Most of the early efforts in aerodynamics were directed toward achieving heavier-than-air flight, which was first demonstrated by Otto Lilienthal in 1891. Since then, the use of aerodynamics through mathematical analysis, empirical approximations, wind tunnel experimentation, and computer simulations has formed a rational basis for the development of heavier-than-air flight and a number of other technologies. Recent work in aerodynamics has focused on issues related to compressible flow, turbulence, and boundary layers and has become increasingly computational in nature.\n\n",
    "slipstream": "A slipstream is a region behind a moving object in which a wake of fluid (typically air or water) is moving at velocities comparable to that of the moving object, relative to the ambient fluid through which the object is moving. The term slipstream also applies to the similar region adjacent to an object with a fluid moving around it. \"Slipstreaming\" or \"drafting\" works because of the relative motion of the fluid in the slipstream.\n\n",
    "viscoelasticity": "In materials science and continuum mechanics, viscoelasticity is the property of materials that exhibit both viscous and elastic characteristics when undergoing deformation. Viscous materials, like water, resist both shear flow and strain linearly with time when a stress is applied. Elastic materials strain when stretched and immediately return to their original state once the stress is removed.\nViscoelastic materials have elements of both of these properties and, as such, exhibit time-dependent strain. Whereas elasticity is usually the result of bond stretching along crystallographic planes in an ordered solid, viscosity is the result of the diffusion of atoms or molecules inside an amorphous material.\n\n",
    "lifting": "A lifting gas or lighter-than-air gas is a gas that has a density lower than normal atmospheric gases and rises above them as a result, making it useful in lifting lighter-than-air aircraft. Only certain lighter-than-air gases are suitable as lifting gases. Dry air has a density of about 1.29 g/L (gram per liter) at standard conditions for temperature and pressure (STP) and an average molecular mass of 28.97 g/mol, and so lighter-than-air gases have a density lower than this.",
    "flowmeter": "Flow measurement is the quantification of bulk fluid movement.  Flow can be measured using devices called flowmeters in various ways. The common types of flowmeters with industrial applications are listed below:\n\nObstruction type (differential pressure or variable area)\nInferential (turbine type)\nElectromagnetic\nPositive-displacement flowmeters, which accumulate a fixed volume of fluid and then count the number of times the volume is filled to measure flow.\nFluid dynamic (vortex shedding)\nAnemometer\nUltrasonic flow meter\nMass flow meter (Coriolis force).\nFlow measurement methods other than positive-displacement flowmeters rely on forces produced by the flowing stream as it overcomes a known constriction, to indirectly calculate flow. Flow may be measured by measuring the velocity of fluid over a known area. For very large flows, tracer methods may be used to deduce the flow rate from the change in concentration of a dye or radioisotope.",
    "deflection": "A deflection yoke is a kind of magnetic lens, used in cathode ray tubes to scan the electron beam both vertically and horizontally over the whole screen.\nIn a CRT television, the electron beam is moved in a raster scan on the screen. By adjusting the strength of the beam current, the brightness of the light produced by the phosphor on the screen can be varied.  The cathode ray tube allowed the development of all-electronic television.\nElectromagnetic deflection yokes are also used in certain radar displays.",
    "drosophila": "Drosophila (), from Ancient Greek \u03b4\u03c1\u03cc\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2 (dr\u00f3sos), meaning \"dew\", and \u03c6\u03af\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2 (ph\u00edlos), meaning \"loving\", is a genus of fly, belonging to the family Drosophilidae, whose members are often called \"small fruit flies\" or pomace flies, vinegar flies, or wine flies, a reference to the characteristic of many species to linger around overripe or rotting fruit. They should not be confused with the Tephritidae, a related family, which are also called fruit flies (sometimes referred to as \"true fruit flies\"); tephritids feed primarily on unripe or ripe fruit, with many species being regarded as destructive agricultural pests, especially the Mediterranean fruit fly.\nOne species of Drosophila in particular, Drosophila melanogaster, has been heavily used in research in genetics and is a common model organism in developmental biology. The terms \"fruit fly\" and \"Drosophila\" are often used synonymously with D. melanogaster in modern biological literature. The entire genus, however, contains more than 1,500 species and is very diverse in appearance, behavior, and breeding habitat.",
    "define": "A definition is a statement of the meaning of a term (a word, phrase, or other set of symbols). Definitions can be classified into two large categories: intensional definitions (which try to give the sense of a term), and extensional definitions (which try to list the objects that a term describes). Another important category of definitions is the class of ostensive definitions, which convey the meaning of a term by pointing out examples. A term may have many different senses and multiple meanings, and thus require multiple definitions.\nIn mathematics, a definition is used to give a precise meaning to a new term, by describing a condition which unambiguously qualifies what the mathematical term is and is not. Definitions and axioms form the basis on which all of modern mathematics is to be constructed.\n\n",
    "induce": "In molecular biology, an inducer is a molecule that regulates gene expression. An inducer functions in two ways; namely:\n\nBy disabling repressors. The gene is expressed because an inducer binds to the repressor. The binding of the inducer to the repressor prevents the repressor from binding to the operator. RNA polymerase can then begin to transcribe operon genes.\nBy binding to activators. Activators generally bind poorly to activator DNA sequences unless an inducer is present. Activator binds to an inducer and the complex binds to the activation sequence and activates target gene. Removing the inducer stops transcription.\nBecause a small inducer molecule is required, the increased expression of the target gene is called induction. The lactose operon is one example of an inducible system.",
    "discontinuity": "Continuous functions are of utmost importance in mathematics, functions and applications. However, not all functions are continuous. If a function is not continuous at a limit point (also called \"accumulation point\" or \"cluster point\") of its domain, one says that it has a discontinuity there. The set of all points of discontinuity of a function may be a discrete set, a dense set, or even the entire domain of the function.\nThe oscillation of a function at a point quantifies these discontinuities as follows:\n\nin a removable discontinuity, the distance that the value of the function is off by is the oscillation;\nin a jump discontinuity, the size of the jump is the oscillation (assuming that the value at the point lies between these limits of the two sides);\nin an essential discontinuity (a.k.a. infinite discontinuity), oscillation measures the failure of a limit to exist.\nA special case is if the function diverges to infinity or minus infinity, in which case the oscillation is not defined (in the extended real numbers, this is a removable discontinuity).\n\n"
